                        weather-related problems.</p>
                    <p><i><span class="bold">Living in Places with Extreme Weather</span></i> is the anchor text for
                        this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <i><span
                                class="bold">Living in Places with Extreme Weather</span></i> for independent reading,
                        or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground
                        students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As
                        students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as
                        the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text structures and text features appear across the texts in this set.

                        repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">When we have a problem, we look for a <span
                                class="bold">solution</span>. One weather problem is that a flood could damage a house.
                            What is a <span class="bold">solution</span> to this problem?</span> Or: <span

                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>How do people solve weather-related issues?</i> Ask:
                        <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Raising Chicago</i> will help you consider the
                            Big Question? Think about the title and how it might relate to a weather-related issue or

                            class="bold"><i>flooding</i></span> and <span class="bold"><i>moisture</i>.</span> Discuss
                        the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What causes <span
                                class="bold">flooding?</span> What kinds of weather might involve <span

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">ORAL VOCABULARY</span></h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Raising Chicago</i> might be new or challenging, such as <i><span
                                class="bold">solution</span></i> or <i><span class="bold">issue.</span></i> During class
                        discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For
                        example: <span class="blue_scripting">What are some <span class="bold">issues</span> or problems
                            that flooding causes?</span> Or: <span class="blue_scripting">What were some <span

                        problems and solutions from the text as they read. For example, they may add the words
                        <i>floods</i> and <i>moisture</i> in the <i>Problems</i> column, and the words <i>planks</i> and
                        <i>raising the streets</i> in the <i>Solutions</i> column.

                        will describe more than one solution to a problem. Encourage students to think about which
                        solutions work and don’t work as they read.</p>
                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Problem-and-Solution

                        and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “tells how a problem can be

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Think about texts you

                        they will read about a solution that was tried, but didn’t work.</p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Headings.” Work with the class to
                        fill in the column with examples of how headings help readers understand the text. For example:

                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Staying Safe from Hurricanes</i> might be new or challenging, such
                        as <i>predict</i> or <i>material.</i> During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly
                        to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">What <span
                                class="bold">material</span> would protect a house from strong winds?</span> Or: <span

                    <p>Share a two-column chart. To guide critical thinking about weather problems and their solutions,
                        have students create two-column charts of their own, labeling the first column <i>Problems</i>
                        and the second column <i>Solutions.</i> Encourage students to use vocabulary words as they think
                        of problems and solutions to add to their charts—for example, the word
                        <i>hurricanes</i> in the <i>Problems</i> column, with the corresponding word <i>evacuate</i> in
                        the <i>Solutions</i> column.

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Structure</span> Explain that most of <i>Staying Safe from Hurricanes</i>
                        has a cause-and-effect text structure. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">An effect is an event
                            that happens. A cause is why an event happens. Look for clue words that describe causes and
                            effects, such as <i>because</i> and <i>as a result.</i></span> Direct students to the
                        section "What Are the Effects of a Hurricane?" Guide
                        them to identify clue words for a cause-and-effect structure, such as <i>effects, cause,</i> and
                        <i>lead to.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Cause-and-Effect
                        Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about this structure,
                        and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “tells why events happen”</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Think about texts you
                            have you read that have headings. A heading can help readers
                            find information quickly. It can also show the structure of a text.</span> Ask students to
                        find the first heading in the text. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What does this heading
                            show about the text structure?</span> Guide students to understand that the heading "What
                        Causes a Hurricane to Form" helps to show that the text will be about causes and effects.

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write "Headings." Work with the class to
                        fill in the
                        column with examples of how headings help readers understand the text. For example: "help

                        <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Forecasting the Weather</i> will help you think

                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the following words: <i><span
                                class="bold">meteorologist</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">forecast.</span></i>
                        Discuss the meaning of each word or phrase with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">A
                            <span class="bold">meteorologist</span> is a scientist who studies the weather. What do you
                            think a <span class="bold">meteorologist</span> does? A <span class="bold">forecast</span>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold">ORAL VOCABULARY</h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Forecasting the Weather</i> might be new or challenging, such as
                        <i><span class="bold">predict.</span></i> During class discussions, use these new terms
                        repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span
                            class="blue_scripting">When you predict something, you say what you think will happen. How
                            do meteorologists <span class="bold">predict</span> the weather?</span></p>

                        create two-column charts of their own. Encourage students to use vocabulary words as they think
                        of problems and solutions to add to their charts. For example, they can add the phrase
                        <i>weather emergencies</i> in the <i>Problems</i> column, and the word <i>forecasts</i> in
                        the <i>Solutions</i> column. A completed chart might look like this:

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column write “Photographs.” Work with the class to

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true"> .</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span class="solidl"
                            aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.</span>”</p>
